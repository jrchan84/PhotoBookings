# PhotoBookings
PhotoBookings is a UBC CPSC 210 project of mine I developed to help with another passion of mine, photography. As a way to learn about OOP and program structures, I wanted to make an application to help manage client bookings and tasks in an aesthetic interface. The program supports the viewing, adding, removing, and searching of different bookings while reading and updating a local file containing the data.

Aesthetics:

I've always had an appreciation for stunning and responsive interface design. I made it a priority to make an application that looks good and that I would personally actually use.


Functionality:

- Addition, removal, viewing, and searching of
 booking items.
- Retrieval and updating of information to a file
- Input error checking and response


Programming Practices:

As a school project, this application has a focus in fundamental practices and structures such as black-box testing with JUnit, implementing scalable booking structures, and design patterns like Java's Observer to recognize active and old bookings.

PhotoBookings was primarily a learning experience and my first attempt at making a complete application. It taught me a lot about Java and the process behind making a well-written program.
